# Lip-Sync

### Steps to Follow:
This code should be run in google colab.
1. Create two folders in your google drive namely `Wav2Lip` and `Wav2lip`
2. In `Wav2Lip` you will be storing your input files. whereas in `Wav2lip` you will be storing your pre-trained model taken from the `Wav2Lip` repo.
3. Next go to google colab navigate to the code cell below the markdown stating `Now let's try!` change the input to the file you want to process. Do the same for the cell below it as well.
4. Now if you run all the cells, you will get the output in the `Wav2Lip` folder. I have already attached the inputs and the acquired output in the repo.
